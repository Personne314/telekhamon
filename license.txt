Project: Télékhamon

Télékhamon is a rogue-like deckbuilder that incorporates gacha elements.  
The player takes on the role of a mummy moving through various floors of a pyramid filled with enemies.  
As they progress, they face off against different opponents in combat, fighting with the help of cards.  
Each victory brings monetary rewards, which allow the player to buy randomly selected cards  
from a pool of over 20 different cards. To win, the player must defeat the boss on each floor to  
ultimately escape the pyramid.
